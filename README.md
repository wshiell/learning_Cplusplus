- learning_Cplusplus/Undergrad Object Oriented Programming containpractical-08-11 - contains information from an object-oriented programming course taken at the 
University of Adelaide in 2019.  The sub-folder 'practical-08-11' contains an incomplete chess program which formed the centrepiece of the course (note: the program was
somewhat ambitious for the course and given the time available to complete it it's understandable that it was never completed. What was required in writing this program
was to illustrate an understanding of the course content - ie. all relevant topics needed to be addressed (encapuslation, polymorphism, etc.). This was accomplished even
though the program itself was never completed.
