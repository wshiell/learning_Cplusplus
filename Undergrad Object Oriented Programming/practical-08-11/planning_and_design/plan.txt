** OOP Major Project Plan Specifications **

-------------------------------------------

The principle purpose of my project is to create a two (human) player chess game. The players will be
able to see the layout of the board as it appears before their next move, and will be able to input
their moves using row and column notation (ie. to move a piece from A4 to C5, the player might enter
something like '> A4 -> C5'). The program will initially display the board, pieces and relevant
statistics in a basic ASCII character format, but if I am able to complete the primary mechanical
aspects of the program withint the alloted time, I will endeavour to add some more advanced graphical
functionality using the ncurses library. Finally, time permitting, I will attempt to create rudimentary
computer opponent for human players to challenge. Also (time permitting again), I will attempt to vary
the board layout, type of pieces and rule set to allow for variations in the game (ie. 10x10 boards,
three dimensional boards, fairy pieces, non-standard rules).

Goal summary:

*Primary goal: create two (human) player chess game with basic graphical format
*Secondary goal: add more advanced graphics to the program using the ncurses library
* Tertiary goals:
  - Create basic computer opponent
  - Vary board topology, piece set and game rules to create non-standard game variations
  
Initial milestones:

* Wednesday Week 9: Basic game program complete
* Wednesday Week 10: Additional graphical capabilities included
* Wednesday Week 11: Computer opponent and/or varations to the basic game added. Program complete.
